## Normative Restraining Bolt Experiments

Below are instructions for running the experiments for "Enforcing Norms in Reinforcement Learning Agents via Restraining Bolts".

To generate the trajectory for the "pacifist" normative system run: `python3 tests/test_ctd.py`

To generate the trajectory for the "environmentally friendly" normative system run: `python3 tests/test_permissions_specificity.py`

To generate the trajectory for the "early" normative system run: `python3 tests/test_achievement.py`

To generate the trajectory for the "late" normative system run: `python3 tests/test_maintenance.py`
