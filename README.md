## Normative Restraining Bolt Experiments

Below are instructions for running the experiments for "Enforcing Norms in Reinforcement Learning Agents via Restraining Bolts".

To generate the trajectory for the "pacifist" normative system run: `python3 test_ctd.py`

To generate the trajectory for the "environmentally friendly" normative system run: `python3 test_permissions_specificity.py`

To generate the trajectory for the "early" normative system run: `python3 test_achievement.py`

To generate the trajectory for the "late" normative system run: `python3 test_maintenance.py`

The automata for the case studies were generated [here](http://ltlf2dfa.diag.uniroma1.it/).
